            A virtual ticketing system developed by 4 students of Ballari Institute of Technology and Management
            who are as of 2024 in their 2nd year pursuing AI & ML.
            This is a project we were asked to develop as a part of our internship program under the guidance of 
            Mr Bijen Singha Sir. 
            This project is purely based on python and use of streamlit for the UI and deployment.
